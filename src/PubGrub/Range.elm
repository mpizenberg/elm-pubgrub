import PubGrub.Version as Version exposing (Version)


{-| A range corresponds to any set of versions
representable as a concatenation, union, and complement
of version ranges building blocks.

Those building blocks are:

  - `none`: the empty set
  - `any`: the set of all possible versions
  - `exact v`: the singleton set of only version `v`
  - `higherThan v`: the set of versions higher or equal to `v`
  - `lowerThan v`: the set of versions strictly lower than `v`
  - `between v1 v2`: the set of versions higher or equal
    to `v1` and strictly lower than `v2`

Internally, they are represented as an ordered list of intervals
to have a normalized form enabling comparisons of ranges.

type Range
    = Range (List Interval)


{-| Finite or infinite interval.
If the second element of the tuple is `Nothing`,
this is an infinite interval of the form [v, +∞[.
All other intervals are of the form [v1, v2[
where the second element of the tuple is excluded.
