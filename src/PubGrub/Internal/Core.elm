{-| PubGrub version solving algorithm.

PubGrub is a version solving algorithm,
written in 2018 by Natalie Weizenbaum
for the Dart package manager.
It is supposed to be very fast and to explain errors
more clearly than the alternatives.
An introductory blog post was
[published on Medium][medium-pubgrub] by its author.

The detailed explanation of the algorithm is
[provided on GitHub][github-pubgrub].
The foundation of the algorithm is based on ASP (Answer Set Programming)
and a book called
"[Answer Set Solving in Practice][potassco-book]"
by Martin Gebser, Roland Kaminski, Benjamin Kaufmann and Torsten Schaub.

This module contains the core model and functions
to write a functional PubGrub algorithm.

{-| Heuristic to pick the next package to add to the partial solution.
This should be a package with a positive derivation but no decision yet.
If multiple choices are possible, use a heuristic.

Pub chooses the package with the fewest versions
matching the outstanding constraint.
This tends to find conflicts earlier if any exist,
since these packages will run out of versions to try more quickly.
But there's likely room for improvement in these heuristics.

Here we just pick the first one.

{-| Pub chooses the latest matching version of the package
