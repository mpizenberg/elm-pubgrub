{-| A term is the fundamental unit of operation of the PubGrub algorithm.
It is a positive or negative expression regarding a selection of versions.
This module exposes types and functions to deal with terms.

{-| A positive or negative expression regarding a selection of versions.

For example, "1.0.0 <= v < 2.0.0" is a positive expression
that is evaluated true if a version is selected and
comprised between version 1.0.0 and version 2.0.0.
The term "not v < 3.0.0" is a negative expression
that is evaluated true if a version is selected >= 3.0.0
or if no version is selected at all.

{-| Describe a relation between a term and another set of terms.
Here is a description extracted from PubGrub documentation.

We say that a set of terms S "satisfies"
a term t if t must be true whenever every term in S is true.
Conversely, S "contradicts" t if t must be false
whenever every term in S is true.
If neither of these is true
we say that S is "inconclusive" for t.
As a shorthand, we say that
a term v satisfies or contradicts t if
{v} satisfies or contradicts it.

-- Debug


{-| String representation of a term, for debug purposes.

-- Functions


{-| Simply check if a term is positive.
-}

        Positive _ ->
            True

        _ ->
            False


{-| Negate a term.
Evaluation of a negated term always returns the opposite
of the evaluation of the original one.
-}
negate : Term -> Term
negate term =
    case term of
        Positive range ->
            Negative range

        Negative range ->
            Positive range


{-| Check if a set of terms satisfies or contradicts
a given term. Otherwise the relation is inconclusive.

{-| Compute the intersection of a list of terms.
An initial term may be provided.
Otherwise `not âˆ…` will be used as initialization for the intersection.

Wondering if it would be better to return a Maybe Term
and let the caller decide what should mean
the intersection of an empty list of terms.

-}
listIntersection : Maybe Term -> List Term -> Term
listIntersection initial terms =
    List.foldl intersection (Maybe.withDefault (Negative Range.none) initial) terms


{-| Check if a set of terms contradicts a given term.

We say that a set of terms S "contradicts"
a term t if t must be false whenever every term in S is true.

-}
contradicts : Term -> List Term -> Bool
contradicts term set =

We say that a set of terms S "satisfies"
a term t if t must be true whenever every term in S is true.

If at least one term is positive,
the intersection is a positive term.

If at least one term is negative,
the union is a negative term.
-}
union : Term -> Term -> Term

(or absence of choice) of a version.
