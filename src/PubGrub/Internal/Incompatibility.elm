{-| An incompatibility is a set of terms that should never
be satisfied all together.

An incompatibility usually originated from a package dependency.
For example, if package A at version 1 depends on package B
at version 2, you can never have both terms `A = 1`
and `not B = 2` satisfied at the same time in a partial solution.
This would mean that we found a solution with package A at version 1
but not with package B at version 2.
Yet A@1 depends on B@2 so this is not possible.
Therefore, the set `{ A = 1, not B = 2 }` is an incompatibility.

Incompatibilities can also be derived from two other incompatibilities
during conflict resolution. More about all this in
[PubGrub documentation](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/blob/master/doc/solver.md#incompatibility).

This type holds a dual implementation for efficient runtime.
Both a temporally ordered list of terms,
and an organized dictionary of packages are useful
at different moments in the PubGrub algorithm.

{-| A Relation describes how a set of terms can be compared to an incompatibility.

We say that a set of terms S satisfies an incompatibility I
if S satisfies every term in I.
We say that S contradicts I
if S contradicts at least one term in I.
If S satisfies all but one of I's terms and is inconclusive for the remaining term,
we say S "almost satisfies" I and we call the remaining term the "unsatisfied term".
Otherwise, we say that their relation is inconclusive.

{-| Add incompatibilities obtained from dependencies in to the set of incompatibilities.

Pubgrub collapses identical dependencies from adjacent package versions
into individual incompatibilities.
This substantially reduces the total number of incompatibilities
and makes it much easier for Pubgrub to reason about multiple versions of packages at once.
For example, rather than representing
foo 1.0.0 depends on bar ^1.0.0 and
foo 1.1.0 depends on bar ^1.0.0
as two separate incompatibilities,
they're collapsed together into the single incompatibility {foo ^1.0.0, not bar ^1.0.0}
(provided that no other version of foo exists between 1.0.0 and 2.0.0).

Here we do the simple stupid thing of just growing the list.
TODO: improve this. It may not be trivial since those incompatibilities
may already have derived others.
Maybe this should not be pursued.
