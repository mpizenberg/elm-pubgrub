{-| Memory is the set of all assignments previous to (including)
its paired assignment in the partial solution list.

Those previous assignments are regrouped by package,
making it easier to find out if a decision was made for a given package,
and to list all corresponding derivations of a package.

Contrary to PartialSolution, Memory does not store derivations causes,
only the terms.
