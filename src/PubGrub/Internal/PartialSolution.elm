{-| The partial solution is the current state of our solution.
It is composed by a succession of assignments,
which are either decisions or derivations.

Internally, it has a dual representation in our implementation.
A list enables fast backtracking into a previous correct state
when solving conflicts,
and a memory dictionary is useful in other parts of the algorithm
requiring fast access to a given package in previous assignments.
It could be fun to benchmark to check that it is actually useful.
