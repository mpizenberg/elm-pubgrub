module PubGrub exposing (solve)

{-| PubGrub version solving algorithm.

PubGrub is a version solving algorithm,
written in 2018 by Natalie Weizenbaum
for the Dart package manager.
It is supposed to be very fast and to explain errors
more clearly than the alternatives.
An introductory blog post was
[published on Medium][medium-pubgrub] by its author.

The detailed explanation of the algorithm is
[provided on GitHub][github-pubgrub].
The foundation of the algorithm is based on ASP (Answer Set Programming)
and a book called
"[Answer Set Solving in Practice][potassco-book]"
by Martin Gebser, Roland Kaminski, Benjamin Kaufmann and Torsten Schaub.

{-| Heuristic to pick the next package & version to add to the partial solution.
This should be a package with a positive derivation but no decision yet.
If multiple choices are possible, use a heuristic.

Pub chooses the latest matching version of the package
with the fewest versions that match the outstanding constraint.
This tends to find conflicts earlier if any exist,
since these packages will run out of versions to try more quickly.
But there's likely room for improvement in these heuristics.

Let "term" be the intersection of all assignment in the partial solution
referring to that package.
If no version matches that term return an error with
the package name and the incompatibity {term}.
